# independently of pi-robot.service so a crashed firmware still exposes
# `ssh pi@10.55.0.1` (ECM) and a serial console at /dev/ttyGS0 (ACM).

# Diagnostic logging block runs WITHOUT `set -e` — its failure must not
# prevent the gadget setup. The previous version coupled them, so a
# transient /boot/firmware-not-yet-mounted at unit-start time silently
# aborted the entire script before any ConfigFS work happened. Gadget
# setup re-enables -e at the marker below.

# host). Append, not overwrite, so multi-boot failure patterns stay
# visible. Only redirect when /boot/firmware looks writable — otherwise
# let stdout/stderr fall through to systemd's journal.
